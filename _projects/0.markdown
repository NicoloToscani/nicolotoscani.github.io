title: vibration-analysis 
description: Vibration Analysis for Predictive Maintenance
---

Identify and predict failures in rotating machinery using high frequency vibration data to classify its behavior as normal or anomalous and generating alerts when not all system parameters are known.

The goals of the [vibration-analysis](https://github.com/NicoloToscani/vibration-analysis) project are:
<ul>    
    <li>
        Compare monitored values with the ISO 10816 standard
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a model using differents machine learning techniques
    </li>
</ul>
